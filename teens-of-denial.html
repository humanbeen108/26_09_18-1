<p><h3>Will Toledo, the singer/songwriter/visionary of Car Seat Headrest, is adept at both, 
    having developed them over the course of his eleven college-recorded Bandcamp albums and his retrospective collection last fall, Teens of Style. 
    With Teens of Denial, his first real "studio" album with an actual band, 
    Toledo moves from bedroom pop to something approaching classic-rock grandeur and huge (if detailed and personal) narrative ambitions, 
    with nods to the Cars, Pavement, Jonathan Richman, Wire, and William Onyeabor. </h3></p>
