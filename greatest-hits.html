<p><h3>Remo Drive is an emo band from Minnesota, trying to put the midwestern back in midwestern emo. 
    After releasing a few EPs, splits, and singles dating back to 2014, Remo Drive self-released their debut album, Greatest Hits in March 2017. 
    The lead single from the album gained them traction and recognition. Before this, they were relatively unknown. 
    They have toured or going to tour with bands like McCafferty, Hippo Campus, and Sorority Noise. 
    This background is rather brief because they are a new band to the scene and public.</h3></p>
