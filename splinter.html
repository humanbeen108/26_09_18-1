<p><h3>Splinter is the second full studio album from Sneaker Pimps. 
    Released on October 25, 1999, Splinter is the first release from the band without Kelli Dayton singing lead vocals; 
    she was replaced by founding band member Chris Corner. The sound of the album was a great change from their first album. 
    Most notably it was a darker sound which favored acoustic guitars, dark lyrics, and male vocals.</h3></p>
